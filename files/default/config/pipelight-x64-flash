# a timer based approach is preferred over async calls and the

# browser capabilities. Setting the following option to true
# forces the plugin to use async calls. This might be mainly
# useful for testing the difference between both event handling
# approaches. [default: false]

# The opera browser claims to provide timer functions, but they
